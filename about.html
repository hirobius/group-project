      <p>Adrian ABOUT ME:
        Work-wise, Iâ€™m into Layout, Typography, Motion and designing micro-interactions. I really enjoy 3D sculpting
        in my
        spare time outside of learning to code. All-around multifaceted skillset. Attention to detail, simplicity and
        transparency are pretty high up on my list. Music all the time. Motorcycles (Trackers, Scramblers, Choppers
        and
        Cruisers). WA Air National Guard.</p>

      <h2>Louis Lassegue</h2>
      <p>Software Engineer</p>
      <p>Hello, I am Louis Lassegue. After 15 years in retail environments specializing in inventory and logistics, it
        is clear software development helps the world operate more accurately and efficiently.
        I decided to go into software development for a few reasons. One, I wanted a career that would stand the test
        of time. Two, software engineers often work in a team environment, an environment I enjoy, and three, having
        continuous challenges on a day to day basis keeps me engaged.
        I want to master the skill of coding in order to have the ability to work in multiple environments.
        Preferably, I would like to work for a company that focuses on providing solutions to everyday problems.
        Additionally it is important that the organization prides themselves on creating an environment of inclusion
        and that encourages outside the box solutioning.
        My experiences in bringing people together in order to problem solve under pressure, the ability to create
        environments of inclusion and my desire to help provide solutions to everyone are the reasons you want me on
        your team.</p>
